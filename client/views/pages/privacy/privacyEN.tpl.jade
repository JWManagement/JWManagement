        h2 Access data
        p We, the website operator or page provider, collect data about accesses to the website on the basis of our legitimate interest (see Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR) and store them as "server log files" on the website server. The following data is logged in this way:

        p The server log files are stored for a maximum of 7 days and then deleted. The data is stored for security reasons, e.g. to be able to clarify cases of abuse. If data must be retained for evidentiary reasons, it is exempt from deletion until the incident has been finally clarified.

GDPR the service "Google Analytics", which is offered by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).

        p IP anonymization is used on this website. The IP address of the user is shortened within the member states of the EU and the European Economic Area and in the other contracting states of the agreement.

The IP address of the user transmitted by the browser is not combined with other data stored by Google.
        p As part of the agreement on the order data agreement, which we as website operators have concluded with Google Inc., the latter uses the information collected to create an evaluation of website use and website activity and provides services associated with internet use.
